# Capstone_Bruestle_Boudia_Chen
Repository for our MADS Capstone on airline prediction task
The main question is How can we empower travelers to make informed decisions and effectively plan their trips ahead of time?

We want to leverage historical airline and weather data to create a prediction for the travelers to have more insight into the probability of their flight cancellation/delay.
